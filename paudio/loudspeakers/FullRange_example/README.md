## Full Range example

All pcm files are fake ones, just to illustrate `.pcm` files naming


### Optional: full range EQ

If you want to apply some FIR to fine EQ your full range loudspeaker, yo can prepare and add here a file named `xo.fr.pcm`.

If this file is omitted, no loudspeaker filtering will be applied
